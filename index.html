    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players; //reference

    console.log(players, team);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = "Yiseul";

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    console.log(players, team); 

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice();

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    team4[3] = "Jamie";
    console.log(team4);

    // or use from method
    const team5 = Array.from(players);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    //captain.number = 7; //modify person

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const captain2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 99, age:20});

    // object ...spread
    const captain3 = {...person};
    captain3.pet = "Kitty";

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
